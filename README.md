# Movie_Recommendation_Spark

In this project, I built a movie recommendation engine with alternative least square (AlS) model with Spark Python and SQL. In the Netflix movie rating data, there are more than 280K users give around 27.7M rating to 50K movies. All the work is in the notebook.  
  
  
Here is some pictures cannot display in the notebook:
  
  
This picture on the **left side** illustrates the **average rating score for each category of movies**, while the **right** one shows the **rating number that each category received**.

This is learning curve of training and validation for ALS model.
